# ESP32 Development Container

See [official specs](https://containers.dev/) and [vscode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for more information about dev containers and how to use.

The ESP32 Audit container has been designed to run as both a standalone container and a dev container primarily to cater to users who either want to use their own setup for auditing (e.g. Vim/Emacs) or use VS Code.

As the container provides the whole audit environment, no attempt is made to reduce image sizes.
